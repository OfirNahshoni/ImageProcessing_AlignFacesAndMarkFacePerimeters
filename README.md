# ImageProcessing_AlignFacesAndMarkFacePerimeters
Final project in Image Processing and Computer Vision, implemented in MATLAB.

The presentation is added to this folder. This is a project which his main goal is to use the techniques that
I leanred in Image Processing and Computer Vision, and test their limits. Topics like: Affine transformations, 
morphologic operations (opening). Honestly I have to say that my algorithm is not generic to other inputs.

input: Video of my girlfriend moving the head from one side to the other. This video was added also to this folder.

Pre-Processing stages: This steps include 2 step of filter.

This project have 2 main programs:

1) StepByStepMain.m: This program is running a frame from the input video one after the next.
